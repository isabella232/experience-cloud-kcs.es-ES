# Bloquear ataque de inyección SQL

## Descripción


`Exactly how to block a SQL injection attack?`


## Resolución


`AEM as a Cloud Service does not offer configurable IP block lists out of the box. Hence use Apache mod_redirect or any other approved module on the dispatcher at project level.`

`SQL injection is prevented by design: The default CQ setup does neither include nor require a traditional database. All data is stored in a content repository (CRX). All access is limited to authenticated users and can only be performed through the JCR API. SQL is supported for search queries only (SELECT).`
